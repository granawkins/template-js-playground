          <h3>Native American Cultures</h3>
          <p>
            For thousands of years, buffalo were central to the survival and
            cultural identity of many Native American tribes. The Plains Indians
            relied on buffalo for food, shelter, tools, and spiritual practices.
            Every part of the animal was used, from meat for sustenance to hides
            for tipis and bones for tools.

          <h3>Westward Expansion</h3>
          <p>
            The mass slaughter of buffalo in the 19th century was closely linked
            to American westward expansion. Railroad companies encouraged
            hunting to feed workers and clear land for tracks. Military leaders
            supported buffalo hunting to undermine Native American resistance by
            removing their primary resource.

          <h3>Conservation Movement</h3>
          <p>
            The near extinction of the American bison became one of the first
            major conservation concerns in U.S. history. Early conservationists
            like William Hornaday and Theodore Roosevelt helped establish
            protected herds. The American Bison Society, founded in 1905, played
            a crucial role in saving the species from extinction.
